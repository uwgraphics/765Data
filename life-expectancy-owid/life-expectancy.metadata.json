        "Across the world, people are living longer. In 1900, the global average life expectancy was 32 years. By 2023, this had more than doubled to 73 years.",
        "Countries around the world made big improvements, and life expectancy more than doubled in every region. This wasn’t just due to falling child mortality; people started living longer at all ages.",
        "Even after World War II, there have been large drops in life expectancy, such as during the Great Leap Forward famine in China, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the Rwandan genocide, or the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Period life expectancy is an indicator that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year. It shows how long the average baby born in that year would be expected to live if they experienced the same chances of dying at each age as people did in that year.",
        "This chart shows long-run estimates of life expectancy compiled by our team from several data sources. Before 1950, for country-level data, we rely on the [Human Mortality Database (2024)](https://www.mortality.org/Data/ZippedDataFiles) combined with [Zijdeman (2015)](https://clio-infra.eu/Indicators/LifeExpectancyatBirthTotal.html). For regional data, we use [Riley (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2005.00083.x).

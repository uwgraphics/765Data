# Datasets curated for CS765 Data Visualization (2025) at UW-Madison

A discussion of how these two data sets are used in class is
available at: https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/765-25/pages/two-data-sets/

The idea is that there are two data sets: one in "wide" format, and the other in "tall" format.

## US Census Data

See the readme file: [census_readme.md](census_readme.md)

The data was obtained from US census data: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/ and processed by course staff.

Data file: [aggregate_census_dataset.csv](aggregate_census_dataset.csv) - **warning:** this is actually tab separated

## Global Lifespan Data

Use of this data set was inspired by a a [class assignment](https://teaching.vda.univie.ac.at/vis/25s/a1.html) at the University of Vienna.

We provide two versions:

- A version that has data post-1960 that includes a breakdown by sex. This data is derived from data from the World Bank.
- A version that has data for a range of years (including historical data from select countries) that was obtained from Our World in Data.

### World Bank Data

See the readme file: [lifespan_readme.md](lifespan_readme.md) 

The data was obtained from Global lifespan data: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN

### Our World in Data Data

Their web page (with some visualizations and explanations) is: https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy. We downloaded the data in September, 2025.
